## Some Scenerios
### make an array with 3 objects of books and iterate through it and print every book's author name
### you have an book object with title, author, bookID, publicationDate and genre properties. Dislpay all the fields of an object
 1. with for in loop
 2. with the help od destructuring
### make an array of even numbers and double each number and save it in new array. Copy the values of arr2 in arr1 with the help of spread op.
### ```let arr = [1,2,3];
  let arr2 = [4,5,6]```  
### ```let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]```  Make new array with name newArr. and copy the values of arr in newArr with the help of spread op
### ``` let obj = {name: 'Civic', model:2020, color:'grey'}```  Show each property of an object. Hint: First extract variables from an object the help of destructuring then show these variables in console.log.
